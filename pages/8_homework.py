# Homework Assignment 2: Build Your Own Streamlit Game 🎮  
   
Hello, aspiring coders! For this week's homework, you're going to step into the shoes of a game developer. Your mission is to create a simple game using Streamlit that incorporates lists, `if` statements, and other interactive elements. The goal is to apply what you've learned in class and get creative with coding!  
   
## Your Task 🚀  
   
Choose one of the following game ideas or come up with your own:  
- **Tic-Tac-Toe**  
- **Card Game (e.g., Black Jack, Higher or Lower, Uno)**  
- **Rock-Paper-Scissors**  
   
Your Streamlit app should have:  
1. **A Game Introduction Page**: Explain the game and its rules.  
2. **A Strategy Guide Page**: Offer tips or strategies on how to win.  
3. **A Game Play Page**: This is where the user can actually play the game.  
   
## Requirements 📝  
   
- **Lists**: Use lists to store game elements (e.g., player moves, deck of cards, choices in Rock-Paper-Scissors).  
- **If Statements**: Implement `if` statements for the game's logic, like determining a winner or handling turns.  
- **Images**: Include images to make your game more visually appealing. For example, use symbols for Tic-Tac-Toe, card images for a card game, or icons for Rock-Paper-Scissors.  
- **Input Widgets**: Add input elements like buttons, sliders, or text input for interactive gameplay.  
- **Interactive Streamlit Elements**: Get creative and use other Streamlit widgets to enhance your game's interactivity and user experience.
